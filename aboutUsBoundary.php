                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <h3>In this project, your team is asked to design and develop a Café staff management system. 
                    <br>The system should support at least the following key aspects. 
                    <br>1. Support and manage different types of users and user profiles (i.e. system admin, cafe owners, cafe
                    managers, cafe staff, etc.).
                    <br>2. Support the cafe owners in viewing and managing work slots. A work slot should have 1 or more cafe
                    staff for each cafe role (i.e. chef, cashier and waiter).
                    <br>3. Support the cafe staff to bid for the work slots/cafe role, and the maximum number of work slots they
                    are available for. A cafe staff should also be able to see the successful or rejected bids. Once assigned,
                    each cafe staff’s role (i.e. chef, cashier and waiter) will not change.
                    <br>4. Support the cafe managers to review cafe staff’s bid and approve/reject them to be assigned to the work
                    slots and cafe role.
                    <br>5. Support the cafe managers to view a list of available cafe staff, and offer other work slots to ensure all
                    work slots are fully allocated and the staff have a balance workload.
                    <br>You must create test data that is sufficiently large enough to simulate the system (e.g. 100 records to each 
                    datatype). You could write a script to generate these data randomly. In the final product demonstration, you 
                    will need to run a live demo of your product with these test data.
